## 🛠 Lab-Based Learning Experience

**80% of your grade comes from hands-on labs** — each designed to build real-world skills:

1. **Lab Structure**

   * Task-oriented challenges with clear objectives
   * Safe environments using containers or local VMs

2. **Submission Workflow**

   * Fork course repository → Create lab branch → Complete tasks
   * Push to fork → Open Pull Request → Receive feedback & evaluation

3. **Grading Advantage**

   * **Perfect Lab Submissions (10/10)**: Exam exemption + bonus points
   * **On-Time Submissions (≥6/10)**: Guaranteed pass (C or higher)
   * **Late Submissions**: Maximum 6/10

---

## 📊 Evaluation Framework

*Transparent assessment for skill validation*

### Grade Composition

* Labs (10 × 8 points each): **80%**
* Final Exam (comprehensive): **20%**

### Performance Tiers
